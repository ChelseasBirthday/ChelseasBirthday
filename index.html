          <p> DAMN, you're almost an adult! One more year Chelsea until you're a young adult! It's pretty crazy how you're two years younger than me and you're so much more mature and capable than me. I'm jealous! xD I really do hope you're having a great time with Dylan and he is treating you well! I hope you're SUPER happy and I hope you get spoilt a lot by Dylan and your family. I don't know if we're best friends anymore but I still consider you my best friend. You really deserve a lot you know. Thank you so much for my last birthday. It was the greatest birthday ever and I really really really really do appreciate all the effort. I guess this birthday gift is my return for what you did for me for my birthday. Just to let you know that you're very special and I took your effort for granted. I was very blinded how much effort you put on me and I didn't realize how special it was. It's crazy how much effort you put on me and I'm am truly sorry for not realizing it. I'm sorry for being a terrible person and you deserve so much more. ANWAYS, this isn't an apology message; it's a website for a very special human celebrating the day you were born. You are very special and a gifted person. You are incredibly nice and caring. You have a really interesting personality and you have a lot of quirks. Something I only realized after we stopped being friends. You're the prettiest girl in the world to me. My point is don't be insecure about yourself because you're smart, you're pretty, and you have the most nurturing and caring personality ever which is literally GOLD. You have both emotional intelligence and logical intelligence which is so amazing and I'm so jealous. You're really awesome at art as well. AHHH. WHY YOU SO AMAZING?! I'm sorry I made you insecure about yourself and damaged your image about yourself... I hope this message heals your self-image about yourself. Also, I told you I'm not the only nice person you'll meet. There are so much more empathetic and nicer people than me you know. Don't be sad okay? Once again nothing is your fault. You didn't hurt me, I hurt myself. Sometimes you may feel insecure about yourself but always force yourself to remember that you're actually fudging amazing (It's a fact). I can't really think of a flaw in your personality, it's literally perfect and I'm very jealous of Dylan that gets to experience it. I hope he treats you like an omnipotent god because you absolutely deserve it.  I really do believe it and I'm not saying it because I'm desperate in getting you back. I know you have moved on and It's okay to move on. I know I’ve said this so many times with the messages you’ve ignored (just kidding xD) but thank you. If anything happens in your life that makes you sad or depressed please remember you’re a very important person. No one in this world can replace you and no can have the same quirks as you. No one can be Chelsea Dwan because you’re the only can be that person. You’re a very loved person and please realize that. You’re extremely capable and strong in life. You’re very gifted. I hope you're enjoying your job at MACCAS and I really hope you get to do the Japan exchange.</p>
          <p>
          
          I wish you the best Birthday and I'm sure you'll get spoiled with so many presents. I hope you liked my birthday gift! :) I'm sorry that the website doesn't look good:'). I'm not very good at coding websites and I have a lot of assignments due very soon so yeah. Have the greatest day and I'm glad that you existed in my life and on this planet. I’m so if I rambled a lot.
